# deep-learning-with-keras
I designed a deep learning model in keras to study the effect of layers and nodes on a model's performance. The validation_loss and training_loss were compared wrt # of epochs. The validation_split was set to 0.2 for all models. 

Looking at the loss vs epochs curves, it looks like there are some overfitting issues in my model. The validation_accuracy varied from 78-83% which does not seem bad.
